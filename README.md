Data Science Final Project Gaston Chevarria

This project has the purpose of carrying out a classification by the K-means and PCA method, of the water quality of the coastal strip of the Rio de la Plata.
The data comes from a set of quarterly samples (2013-2022) that measure the physicochemical and microbiological parameters of the coastal strip (Argentine side) of the RÃ­o de la Plata carried out by the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development in conjunction with the Municipalities that make up the Information Exchange Network of Local Governments (RIIGLO).
The sampling places are: Streams, Rivers, Spas, Canals, Coastal, Ports and Reserves, Beaches, water intakes, North Zone, Avellaneda, Quilmes, Ensenada, Berazategui and Berisso.
